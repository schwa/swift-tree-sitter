     Compare an old edited syntax tree to a new syntax tree representing the same

     For this to work correctly, the old syntax tree must have been edited such
     that its ranges match up to the new tree. Generally, you'll want to call
     this function right after calling one of the `STSParser.parse()` functions.

        - oldTree: The old tree that was passed to parse.
        - newTree: The new tree that was returned from the parser.
